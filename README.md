Coding Style
    1) EMAN2 follows the GNU coding style with minor differences. We use
       GNU indent to make the proper indentation.

    2) The naming styles are:
       a) All source code files use lower cases.
       b) All classes and data types use uppercase in the first letter.
       c) All functions use lower cases with '_' as the word separator.
       d) All parameter names for modular class use lower cases with '_' 
       as the word separator.
